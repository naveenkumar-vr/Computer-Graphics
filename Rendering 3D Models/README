Instruction to use the application:
Press 'a'  --->  load the world coordinates
Press 'c'  --->  load the objects into the world at origin.
Press 'd'  --->  Position the objects at the corners of a triangle.
Press 'e'  --->  Position the objects at the midpoints of the sides of the triangle.
Press 'f'  --->  Rotate the objects by 90 degrees each object about a different axis.
Press 'g'  --->  scale the 3 objects by 0.5x, 2x, 3x respectively.
Press 'r'  --->  reset scale.
Press 'h'  --->  enter pick mode
    Now press 'o'  --->  pick object(default)
Press 'i'  --->  enter camera mode
