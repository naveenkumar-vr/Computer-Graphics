Instruction:
All the files inside the source directory has to be in the same directory to run the program.
To run the program, open the html file, it will redirect to the browser where the program runs.
Now you can create, translate, scale the objects on the canvas and even rotate the scene as mentioned in the report.

Notable effect:
Since in my browser window.close() doesn’t work, as it gives error, it can’t close the JavaScript opened file. 
So I used window.location.replace(’html file location’) to reset the whole program from beginning instead of closing the window.
